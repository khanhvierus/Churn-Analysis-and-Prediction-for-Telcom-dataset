### Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction-for-Telcom-dataset
Problem Statement : A telecommunications company is providing a variety of services to its customers such as Internet, telephone, television, additional services and various payment plans. During its development, the company faced several important challenges:
  •	Customer churn rate remains high, directly affecting revenue.
  •	Differences in demographics, service usage habits and payment method choices make customer segmentation necessary.
  •	The need to analyze factors affecting churn (gender, age, service type, payment method, number of years of service, etc.) to build a customer retention strategy.
The dataset collects detailed information about customers, subscription services, usage behavior, payment, and churn. The goal of the project is to use this data to uncover insights, analyze churn causes, and propose solutions to improve customer experience and increase retention rates.
The dataset to be used in this session is a CSV file named telco.csv, which contains data on telecom customers churning and some of their key behaviors. It contains the following columns:
Customer_ID, Gender , Age, Married, State, Number_of_Referrals, Tenure_in_Months, Value_Deal, Phone_Service, Multiple_Lines, Internet_Service, Internet_Type, Online_Security, Online_Backup, Device_Protection_Plan, Premium_Support, Streaming_TV, Streaming_Movies, Streaming_Music, Unlimited_Data, Contract, Paperless_Billing, Payment_Method, Monthly_Charge, Total_Charges, Total_Refunds, Total_Extra_Data_Charges, Total_Long_Distance_Charges, Total_Revenue, Customer_Status, Churn_Category, Churn_Reason
