## Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction-for-Telcom-dataset
### Problem Statement : 

A telecommunications company is providing a variety of services to its customers such as Internet, telephone, television, additional services and various payment plans. During its development, the company faced several important challenges:

  •	Customer churn rate remains high, directly affecting revenue. <br>
  •	Differences in demographics, service usage habits and payment method choices make customer segmentation necessary. <br>
